== DESCRIPTION:

Chronic is a natural language date/time parser written in pure Ruby. See below for the wide variety of formats Chronic will parse.

== INSTALLATION:

Chronic can be installed via RubyGems:

  $ sudo gem install chronic

== USAGE:

You can parse strings containing a natural language date using the Chronic.parse method.

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'chronic'

  Time.now   #=> Sun Aug 27 23:18:25 PDT 2006

  #---

  Chronic.parse('tomorrow')
    #=> Mon Aug 28 12:00:00 PDT 2006

  Chronic.parse('monday', :context => :past)
    #=> Mon Aug 21 12:00:00 PDT 2006

  Chronic.parse('this tuesday 5:00')
    #=> Tue Aug 29 17:00:00 PDT 2006

  Chronic.parse('this tuesday 5:00', :ambiguous_time_range => :none)
    #=> Tue Aug 29 05:00:00 PDT 2006

  Chronic.parse('may 27th', :now => Time.local(2000, 1, 1))
    #=> Sat May 27 12:00:00 PDT 2000

  Chronic.parse('may 27th', :guess => false)
    #=> Sun May 27 00:00:00 PDT 2007..Mon May 28 00:00:00 PDT 2007

See Chronic.parse for detailed usage instructions.

== EXAMPLES:

Chronic can parse a huge variety of date and time formats. Following is a small sample of strings that will be properly parsed. Parsing is case insensitive and will handle common abbreviations and misspellings.

== LIMITATIONS:

Chronic uses Ruby's built in Time class for all time storage and computation. Because of this, only times that the Time class can handle will be properly parsed. Parsing for times outside of this range will simply return nil. Support for a wider range of times is planned for a future release.

Time zones other than the local one are not currently supported. Support for other time zones is planned for a future release.
